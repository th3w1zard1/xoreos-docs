# xoreos documentation hub

Reverse-engineering resources for BioWare's Aurora engine titles and related formats. This site aggregates the binary specs and tooling notes used across the xoreos project and presents them with a modern, searchable experience.

## Quick navigation

- [File specifications](specs.md) — PDFs, HTML notes, and format descriptions.
- [010 Editor templates](templates.md) — ready-to-use binary templates released under CC0.

## What you will find

The repository includes original documentation from the community (BioWare, Torlack, kiwi.ds, Tanita, and others) alongside scripts and templates for exploring game assets. Everything is preserved as-is while the site adds a responsive layout, integrated table of contents, and search.

## Contributing

If you have additional documentation, corrections, or updated templates, open a pull request. Prefer non-proprietary formats (Markdown, PDF, HTML) and include attribution where appropriate.
